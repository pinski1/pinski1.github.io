The Unnamed will be powered by 2 Gimson GR02s which drive a wheel and a pulley each, which turn another wheel and pulley combo. This gives me four wheeled drive which helps with acceleration and manoeuvrability. However I need something to take the servo signals (a period of 20 milliseconds with a high pulse between 1 millisecond to 2 milliseconds to determine speed and direction) and convert them into motor signals.

A GR02 will, when stalled, pull approximately 61.6 Amps according to the manufacturer. This means I need to find something that can withstand that much current for short moments of time. The best way to do this is to do some research and build up a table of options.

One thing to note about this comparison is that the TZ-85As are only single channel, I will need two to drive both my motors. I'm also not confident that they will withstand 85 Amps continuously. <!-- more when I receive mine -->

One thing I've wanted to do since I started trying to build robots is to build a custom controller. Inspired by the [RageBridge](http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/?cat=85) I'm going to try building a similar version.
