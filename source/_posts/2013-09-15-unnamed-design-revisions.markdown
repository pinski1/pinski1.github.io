After coming up with the first design I posted it on the Fighting Robot Association ([FRA](http://www.fightingrobots.co.uk/)) forums to get some comments and suggestions. One of the worries was that it wouldn't be armoured enough to survive the spinners. Another concern raised was the need for a solid drive-train as the robot would need to be agile and fast to out manoeuvre opponents.

##What's Changed ?##
All the internal UHMWPE support/structure is being replaced with 2"x1"x0.125" aluminium (6063 T3) channel. I'll be buying it from Aluminium Warehouse and they offer a cutting service which I'll use to get the lengths into ~500mm sections. This massively simplifies the mounting of the motors not to mention improving the rigidity of the robot. I'm going to keep the 20mm & 0.5mm tool steel composite armour for the moment however it can be changed out later.

* I'll make nut strip using 12mmx12mm aluminium bar with M6 threads and use that to connect the aluminium channel together.
* The front and rear armour has been upgraded to 4mm-6mm Hardox however this will need to be machined by someone with the tools.
* The top and bottom armour/covers will also be upgraded to 5mm polycarbonate however I'm not too sure how to mount these.
* The lifter will now be powered by 2 linear actuators from Gimson but the overall design & calculations are still in progress.
* The wheels will be Banebots 2-7/8" Shure 50 tires with 3/4" hex mounting, I'll then use the 1/2" to 3/4" key way mount to affix these to the shafts. The gears will hopefully be attached to the wheels but I may get HPC to put a 1/2" key way mount on them too.

The revised total weight is 8.3kg minus lifting arm and revised total cost is &pound;414.06.
