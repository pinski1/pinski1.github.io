	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am an Electronic Engineer working in the south of England. I enjoy trying to build the random ideas that occur to me, some don't work out, but some do and I try to document them here.</p>
	<p>I've been into electronics since I was 14 and into building random things well before that.</p>
