    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After coming up with the first design I posted it on the Fighting Robot Association (<a href="http://www.fightingrobots.co.uk/">FRA</a>) forums to get some comments and suggestions. One of the worries was that it wouldn&rsquo;t be armoured enough to survive the spinners. Another concern raised was the need for a solid drive-train as the robot would need to be agile and fast to out manoeuvre opponents.</p>

<p>You can visit the forum post <a href="http://www.fightingrobots.co.uk/threads/11705-the-unnamed-(fw)">here</a>.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Changed ?</h2>

<p>All the internal UHMWPE support/structure is being replaced with 2"x1"x0.125" aluminium (6063 T3) channel. I&rsquo;ll be buying it from Aluminium Warehouse and they offer a cutting service which I&rsquo;ll use to get the lengths into ~500mm sections. This massively simplifies the mounting of the motors not to mention improving the rigidity of the robot. I&rsquo;m going to keep the 20mm &amp; 0.5mm tool steel composite armour for the moment however it can be changed out later.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll make nut strip using 12mmx12mm aluminium bar with M6 threads and use that to connect the aluminium channel together.</li>
<li>The front and rear armour has been upgraded to 4mm-6mm Hardox however this will need to be machined by someone with the tools.</li>
<li>The top and bottom armour/covers will also be upgraded to 5mm polycarbonate however I&rsquo;m not too sure how to mount these.</li>
<li>The lifter will now be powered by 2 linear actuators from Gimson but the overall design &amp; calculations are still in progress.</li>
<li>The wheels will be Banebots 2-7/8" Shure 50 tires with &frac34;" hex mounting, I&rsquo;ll then use the &frac12;" to &frac34;" key way mount to affix these to the shafts. The gears will hopefully be attached to the wheels but I may get HPC to put a &frac12;" key way mount on them too.</li>
</ul>


<p>The revised total weight is 8.3kg minus lifting arm and revised total cost is &pound;414.06.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to start a blog. I have lots of creative ideas and keep starting projects but never quite finish them. I&rsquo;m hoping that by writing about them I&rsquo;ll end up finishing more of them, or at least getting them to a finished-ish state. So with out further ado&hellip;</p>

<h2>Active projects</h2>

<h3>Makerbot Cupcake-o-Matic</h3>

<p>This is my fairly successful attempt to convert my non-working <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">Makerbot</a> <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/support/cupcake/">Cupcake</a> into a working reliable 3D printer. I&rsquo;ve largely finished this, it just needs the wires hiding to neaten the external appearance, of course it&rsquo;s not quite as simple as that but I&rsquo;ll save that for a subsequent post.</p>

<h3>Prusa i3</h3>

<p>Whilst the Cupcake-o-Matic works, and fairly reliable at that it does only have a 100mm x 100mm x 100mm build volume with a single extruder it&rsquo;s not very expandable. I do want to print large objects in multiple materials and so I began to construct a single sheet style <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3">Prusa i3</a>. I have nearly all of the parts but I still need to print some and design some.</p>

<h3>The Unnamed featherweight</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in combat robots since Robot Wars came out in 1998. I tried my hand at building a featherweight (12Kg max) class robot whilst at secondary school but it didn&rsquo;t work out at all. After reading Charles Guan&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/">blog</a> I&rsquo;ve decided to have another go.</p>

<h3>Powerbridge</h3>

<p>Of course a 12kg combat robot will need some motor controllers, so I resurrected some designs I&rsquo;ve been playing around and started to update them for the featherweight class of robots, it has the preliminary specs of 2x 20Amp 50Volt motor controller with easy firmware updates.</p>

<h3>Claymore MiniSumo</h3>

<p>Another combat robot I&rsquo;ve been designing is a small autonomous 500gram sumo bot, I like the idea of robots that control themselves, the start of Skynet as it were.</p>

<h2>That is it</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to concentrate on these 4 projects until I complete as many of them as possible. My ideas for other projects like: a gokart, a home server, home automation, an updated <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/wavebubble/">Wave Bubble</a> are all going on hiatus.</p>
